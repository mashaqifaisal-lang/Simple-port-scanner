# Simple Port Scanner

This is a very basic port scanner written in Python.
I created this project while learning the basics of cybersecurity and networking.

## What this project does
- Takes an IP address from the user
- Scans a few common ports
- Shows whether the ports are open or closed

## Why I made this
To understand how port scanning works and how services run on different ports.

## Tools
- Python
- socket library

## How to run
python scanner.py

## Note
This project is for learning purposes only.
